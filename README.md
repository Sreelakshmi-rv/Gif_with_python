# ✨ Simple GIF Creator ✨

Ever wanted to quickly stitch two images into a GIF without any hassle? Me too! This is a super simple web app I built for fun to do just that.

It's powered by Python, Streamlit, and a little bit of magic.

## Try It Live!

You can use the live version of the app right here:

### How It Works

It's as easy as it sounds:
1.  Upload your first image.
2.  Upload your second image.
3.  **Heads up!** Both images need to be the exact same size (height and width). If they aren't, the app will let you know.
4.  If the sizes match, *poof*! Your GIF appears, ready for you to preview and download.


That's it! Happy GIF-ing! ✌️
