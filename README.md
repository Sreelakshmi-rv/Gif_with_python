# ✨ Simple GIF Creator ✨

Ever wanted to quickly stitch two images into a GIF without any hassle? Me too! This is a super simple web app I built for fun to do just that.

It's powered by Python, Streamlit, and a little bit of magic.

## Try It Live!

You can use the live version of the app right here:

### How It Works

It's as easy as it sounds:
1.  Upload your first image.
2.  Upload your second image.
3.  **Heads up!** Both images need to be the exact same size (height and width). If they aren't, the app will let you know.
4.  If the sizes match, *poof*! Your GIF appears, ready for you to preview and download.


### Want to Run This on Your Own Machine?

If you want to clone the project and play around with the code, here’s how:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
    *(Don't forget to replace the URL with your actual repository link!)*

2.  **Install the requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the app:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

That's it! Happy GIF-ing! ✌️
